### [Project 1: Predicting and Analyzing Causes of Delay for Flight Departures](https://github.com/hshauntr/CausesOfDelays)
Paired with a growing population is a demand for travel. In our study, we closely examined
airline departure times by comparing their scheduled and actual departure times. We considered a delay to
be any difference of 15 minutes or more and recorded the cause of the delay. To ensure a fair assessment
of each airline’s performance, we collected data from a single airport every day for 10 years. By applying
knowledge we acquired in class, we used R to employ linear regression, trained a mathematical model
and optimized it with least squares to create training and testing sets. By utilizing mathematical analysis
through T values, P values, and R-squared values, our results offer valuable insights into airline
performance regarding flight departures. Our model can be used to predict future performance and
analyze past data to identify the most common causes of delay in the departure statistics. A valuable
resource that can help both airline companies and consumers. This is proven when we practiced our
model on departing flights from Delta Airlines at the San Francisco International Airport from January
2013 until 2023, and recognized that flight carrier delay and late arriving aircraft were the biggest causes
of delays, suggesting that it is well within an airline’s control to improve their on-time performance.

To sum it up, our model did a great job at predicting flight departure times when considering the
major causes of flight delay, with an accuracy of 92.47%. Through mathematical analysis, we were able
to conclude that for our data set of analyzing departure times, within 2013 to 2023 for flights in San
Francisco international airport solely from Delta Airlines, the main factors of flight delays were due to
late aircraft and carrier issues. This is an extremely valuable resource as it gives airlines a direction to
work towards when improving their on-time performance. For example, these issues are well within the
airline’s control, if they could perhaps improve their scheduling or operational procedures, then perhaps
maintenance or crew problems would be minimized. Our model is also easy to understand and it’s able to
clearly depict these relationships between the predictor and response variables.

### [Project 2: Data Structure of a Questionnaire](https://github.com/hshauntr/VotingQuestionnaire)
- Reads survey data file provided and stores the information in a Python data structure
- Ask the user which of the five methods they want to use to select a winner. This being Plurality voting, Borda voting, Condorcet voting, Instant-runoff(IRV) voting, and Approval voting.
- Run an implementation of the chosen voting system and select a winner or declare a draw
- Inform the user of the results, including total votes and winner

### [Project 3: Earthquake Data Visualization](https://github.com/hshauntr/EarthQDataV)
- Read the earthquake data provided from a .csv file, and store the information in a MATLAB data structure. This being a table data structure
- GUI that contains an interactive (capable of zooming and panning) world map, a 2D plot of the earthquake occurrences in the given year, including their location and magnitude. The plot of earthquake occurences over time is also updated every time to highlight the year chose by the user. Utilized through geobubble function to plot earthquake data on the world map.
- Label on all figures, buttons, axes, and plots to provide necessary information. This includes a legend for the earthquake bubble chart.
